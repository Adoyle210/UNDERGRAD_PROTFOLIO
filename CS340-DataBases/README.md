# CS340-DataBases
spring '23 intro to data bases


The team's database was designed to be a companion for aspiring Pokemon trainers which they can use on their journey to becoming Pokemon masters. With a user friendly database, trainers will be abel to track their Pokemon and access important informaiton to aid them on their quest. 

The Pokedex should track and record a Pokemon's name, type, ID and origin, allowing users to eaily organize and manage their Pokemon collection. With the database, trainers will also be able to track their win and loss records.

Throughout this project, we recieved valuable feedback from our peer review sessions and were able to update the implementation and format of our database. 

Some of the key changes we made from the original implementation was to change the way we recorded Pokemon types. From true and false values, we had them be stored as varchars instead. This was a major pain point in our implementation and this change allowed us easier access to updates, adding and also deleting entries.
